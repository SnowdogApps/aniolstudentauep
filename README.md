Students Angel of UEP - app developed during 24 hours NeedApp Hackaton by Snowdog Android Team
The app idea was simple – connecting students with graduates, that shares similar interests.
We all know that being a student is hard. You have to learn a lot, search for something in life that really interests you, go with exams and finally – find the job that matches your skills.
Who wouldn’t like to ask questions about their future jobs to their more experienced colleagues? Who wouldn’t like to be able to find a person that already graduated, and is willing to be a mentor for you, so you can ask all the questions you have about your future career?
A person, that will share his knowledge and experience and to guide the student, so maybe he won’t make same mistakes as they did?

Well, this is what our app was meant to do. We wrote it in around 10h (24h hackaton coding is madness, we take good care of our health and bodies :)), and it’s a working prototype app.
What was achieved:

* Student to graduate matching algorithm based on mutual interest.
* Filtering users to find graduates/students beyond the matching algorithm.
* Simple user invitation system.
* Nice UI and design.
